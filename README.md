##Introduction##
Ever since I was a kid, I noticed that the family who answers most of 
the questions in a round of Family Feud usually has the points stolen by 
the other family. However, families still choose to try and answer the 
rest of the questions during the stand-off at the beginning of the round 
instead of skipping and letting the other team answer the questions. As 
such, I've decided to test whether or not my strategy is best or if the 
overwhelming majority of people of Family Feud are right.
##Assumptions##
I am assuming that each person is equally likely to answer a 
question, that each question has the same number of points (which is 100 
divided by the number of questions), and that each question is likely to 
be picked. This isn't strictly true, but since we average out the scores 
and likelihood of picking a higher or lower question, it's a decent 
enough approximation.
##Results##
The family that doesn't skip maintains a consistent advantage over the other family, although the advantage grows much smaller as the number of questions increase. The scores are close enough for the 8 question scenario that the true situation could very well be in favour of the other family. The model should be refined to get more accurate results.
